  <h1> Coffee Project </h1>

Some silly way to predict coffee preference based on bag description. Main purpose is to describe flavour of coffee using one word label, to standardise coffee experience and to predict preference for people who don't know what they are looking for while beans shopping (aka me)

 <h2> Coffee Dataset </h2>

Coffee dataset is compiled from past purchases and coffee tasted from various people, the majority being me. Relevant information aside from labels and preferences are obtained from roasteries websites and bean bags.
